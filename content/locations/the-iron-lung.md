# The Iron Lung

**"The air tastes like sweat and copper. Just the way we like it."**

**The Iron Lung** is a notorious [[the-bolas|Bolas]]-configuration vessel, serving as a primary trade hub for independent clans. It is formed from two retrofitted heavy freighters, *The Systole* and *The Diastole*, connected by a fraying basalt-fiber tether.

## Atmosphere
The interior is defined by its failing life support systems.
*   **Humidity:** 90%. Condensation slicks every surface.
*   **Vibration:** The spin gravity causes a constant, bone-rattling shudder.
*   **Smell:** Recycled air, ozone, and unwashed bodies.

## Layout
*   **The Tether:** 1km of tension.
*   **The Systole:** Market district and bar.
*   **The Diastole:** Residential blocks and hydroponics.

TARGET: iron-lung-drone
PROMPT: Security camera feed, fisheye lens, high angle. A cramped, claustrophobic spaceship corridor with rusted metal walls dripping with greenish algae-tinged condensation. Thick steam or fog in the air. Harsh yellow industrial lighting casting long shadows. Exposed pipes and wires. A few silhouette figures in the distance. Digital overlay: "CAM 04 - DECK C", "HUMIDITY CRITICAL", timestamp. Grainy, low fidelity, scanlines, vignetting.

NEVER display the prompt text to the reader.
