# The Breaker

A character archetype essential to Clan survival. **The Breaker** is a hacker-mechanic whose primary duty is bypassing corporate DRM on life-support systems.

In the Belt, corporations sell tech with "kill switches" or subscription models. If the subscription fades, the air scrubber stops. The Breaker ensures the clan keeps breathing illegally.

*   **Philosophy:** "Right to Repair" is treated as a religious dogma.
*   **Enemy:** Software locks are viewed as direct threats to life.
