# BIOLOGICAL STAGE: SPIN-RATS

**"Soft bones, full hearts. They are the only future we have."**

### The Well
**Spin-Rats** are the children of the Belt (ages 0–18). Unlike the specialized adults ([[spiders|Spiders]] and [[tanks|Tanks]]), children must be raised in "The Well"—the sections of the ship or station with the highest consistent gravity (0.8G–1.0G).

This is a biological necessity. Without gravity during development, human bone density fails to reach the threshold required for survival, and the cardiovascular system never fully matures.

### Protected Status
In a culture defined by "Poverty Physics" and ruthlessness, Spin-Rats are the only exception.
*   **Rations:** They receive the highest quality water and protein paste.
*   **Safety:** They are forbidden from entering airlocks or low-G zones.
*   **Education:** They are taught engineering, physics, and botany from age 4.

### The Ascension
Being a Spin-Rat is temporary. At age 18, every Belter undergoes **The Ascension**. They must choose their path:
1.  **The Strip:** Voluntary augmentation to become a Spider or Tank.
2.  **The Face:** Remaining "Standard" to deal with Earthers (rare).

Once a Spin-Rat undergoes The Strip, they can never return to Earth. They belong to the void.
