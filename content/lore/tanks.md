# BIOLOGICAL DIVERGENCE: CLASS "TANK"

**"The rock doesn't care if you bleed. So don't."**

### The Physiology of the Void
A **Tank** is a Belter modified for high-radiation environments, heavy labor, and vacuum exposure. Unlike [[spiders|Spiders]], who are built for agility inside the ship, Tanks are built to survive outside it. They work "The Peel"—the surface of asteroids where radiation is lethal to standard humans.

**Modifications:**
1.  **Dermal Plating:** Subdermal lead-polymer mesh is woven into the skin, giving Tanks a distinct grey or metallic sheen. This provides radiation shielding and resistance to micro-meteoroid impacts.
2.  **Ossification:** Bones are reinforced with ceramic lattices to support heavy EVA suits in high-G maneuvers.
3.  **Respiratory Bypass:** Lungs are often replaced or augmented with synthetic scrubbers that can filter low-pressure air and recycle moisture more efficiently than organic tissue.

### Social Role
Tanks are the miners, prospectors, and enforcers. They are physically imposing and often suffer from chronic pain due to the extensive invasive surgery required for their augmentation. In the clan structure, they are the shield; Spiders are the brain.
