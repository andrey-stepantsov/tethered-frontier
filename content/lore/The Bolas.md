# The Bolas

Artificial gravity is physically impossible. To maintain bone density and health, Clans utilize **The Bolas** configuration.

Two ships (or hollowed asteroids) are connected by a 1km-long carbon nanotube cable. The entire assembly spins to create centrifugal force, simulating 0.3G–0.5G.

## Key Concepts
*   **Severance:** The ultimate fear. If the cable snaps, gravity vanishes instantly, and the two halves of the family drift apart into the void.
*   **Docking:** Marriage in the Belt is a physics contract. Two separate clans connect their ships to share stability and resources.
