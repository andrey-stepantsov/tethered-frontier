# SOCIOLOGICAL PROTOCOL: DOCKING

**"Love is physics. Stability is survival."**

### The Physics of Marriage
In the Belt, romantic individualism is a death sentence. A single ship cannot generate spin gravity effectively without a counterweight. **Docking** is the Belter term for marriage, but it is primarily a physics contract.

Two clans agree to connect their ships via a 1km basalt-fiber tether. Once connected, they spin around a common center of mass to generate 0.3G to 0.5G. This artificial gravity allows for:
*   Proper fluid drainage (sanitation).
*   Bone density maintenance for children ([[spin-rats|Spin-Rats]]).
*   Complex chemical processing.

### The Contract
A Docking contract is negotiated by the Clan Elders. It specifies:
1.  **Resource Exchange:** Water filtration rates, air scrubbing duties, and power sharing.
2.  **The Severance Clause:** If the relationship fails, or if one ship becomes a liability (e.g., hull breach, plague), the tether is severed. The ships drift apart, gravity vanishes, and the partnership ends.

In the Belt, you don't say "I do." You say "We are stable."
