# The Strip

The "Airlock Filter" dictates that standard humans are inefficient in the Belt. **The Strip** is the voluntary biological augmentation every "True Belter" undergoes at age 18, marking the transition from "The Well" (childhood) to "The Ascension" (adulthood).

Once Stripped, a Belter can never return to Earth's gravity.

## Classes
*   **Spiders (Techs):** Legs are removed (dead weight in 0G) and replaced with dexterous hands. Inner ears are removed to cure motion sickness.
*   **Tanks (Miners):** Radiation-hardened skin (grey/metallic), reinforced bones, and synthetic lungs for low-pressure environments.
*   **Jacks (Pilots):** Neural shunts installed in the spine to plug directly into ship systems. Bodies often atrophy ("Brains in Jars").
