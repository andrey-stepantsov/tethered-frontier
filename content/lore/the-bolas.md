# The Bolas: Gravity by Necessity

**"Spin or die. Those are the options."**

In the Tethered Frontier, artificial gravity is a myth from Earth. Here, we rely on **The Bolas**: a crude, mechanical solution to the biological necessity of weight.

## The Mechanics
A standard Bolas formation consists of two masses—usually two scavenged ships, or a ship and a hollowed-out asteroid—connected by a 1,000-meter High-Tensile Basalt-Fiber Tether.

Once connected, the pair uses thrusters to initiate a spin. The centrifugal force generates pseudo-gravity.
*   **0.3G:** The minimum for long-term survival.
*   **0.5G:** The luxury standard (rare).
*   **The Hub:** The center of the cable is Zero-G. This is where the **Spin-Rats** (children) play, but it is dangerous territory for unaugmented adults due to the Coriolis effect.

## Severance
The greatest fear in the Belt is **Severance**. If the tether snaps:
1.  **Loss of Gravity:** Instant return to Zero-G.
2.  **Trajectory:** Both ships are flung into the void on tangential vectors at hundreds of meters per second.
3.  **Isolation:** Re-connecting is nearly impossible without fuel reserves, which most clans lack.

## Docking (Marriage)
Because a single ship cannot generate gravity alone, "marriage" in the Belt is a physics problem. Two independent clans agree to **Dock**. They link their ships to share stability.
*   It is a binding contract of mutual survival.
*   Divorce requires "spinning down," wasting precious fuel. Therefore, marriages are usually for life.

PROMPT: Drone feed surveillance footage, fisheye lens, low fidelity, digital noise, monochromatic green tint. Two mismatched, heavily rusted industrial spaceships connected by a thick, braided basalt-fiber tether cable, spinning in the deep black void of space. The ships are patched with scrap metal, looking like junk. Harsh single-source sunlight creates deep shadows and overexposed highlights. HUD overlays, telemetry data, timestamp "SECTOR 4 - LIVE FEED", scanlines, vignetting. Visceral, industrial sci-fi, realistic.
