# The Mirrors

In the **Tethered Frontier**, uranium is strictly hoarded by Earth ("The Leash"). Denied high-density fuel, Belter clans rely on "Poverty Physics" to survive the freezing void.

**The Mirrors** are massive, fragile arrays of Mylar sheets deployed by clan ships. They concentrate weak sunlight to superheat ice for steam rockets and life support.

*   **Vulnerability:** They are easily torn by micrometeoroids or sabotage. A torn mirror means freezing to death.
*   **Tactics:** In conflict, targeting a clan's mirrors is considered a war crime, equivalent to poisoning a well.
