# BIOLOGICAL DIVERGENCE: CLASS "SPIDER"

**"Legs are a luxury tax on oxygen."** — *Common Belter Adage*

### The Physiology of Zero-G
A **Spider** is a Belter who has undergone a specific variation of [[the-strip|The Strip]] optimized for permanent Zero-G environments. In the microgravity of the ship's core (The Web), legs are dead weight. They consume oxygen and blood flow but offer no utility.

**Modifications:**
1.  **Amputation:** Lower limbs are surgically removed at the hip or mid-thigh.
2.  **Prosthetic Dexterity:** In high-status clans, the lower stumps are fitted with myoelectric grippers or "lower hands," allowing the Spider to anchor themselves to bulkheads while working with their primary hands.
3.  **Vestibular Nullification:** The inner ear is surgically dampened or removed to eliminate motion sickness, allowing Spiders to orient instantly in any direction without nausea.

### Social Role
Spiders are the technicians, engineers, and pilots of the Belt. They live in the "Web"—the central axis of the spin-gravity ships where gravity is negligible. Because they cannot walk in gravity wells, they rarely leave their ships. To an Earther, they look like monsters; to a Belter, they look like efficiency.
