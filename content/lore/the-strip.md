# The Strip: Ascension by Knife

**"Earth gave you a body for gravity. The Belt gives you a body for work."**

**The Strip** is the universal rite of passage in the Tethered Frontier. At age 18, a Belter chooses their function. They enter the clinic as a "Standard" human (soft, inefficient) and leave as a specialized tool.

It is irreversible. Once Stripped, you can never return to Earth's gravity well. Your physiology is now tuned exclusively for the void.

## The Procedure
The surgery is performed in Zero-G clinics, often using recycled prosthetics and "generous" amounts of local anesthetic. It is not cosmetic; it is industrial re-purposing.

### Class I: Spiders (Technicians)
*   **Role:** Hull maintenance, zero-g repair.
*   **Modification:** Amputation of legs at the knee. Installation of prehensile manipulators (hands) on the lower stumps.
*   **Benefit:** Legs are dead weight in microgravity. Four hands allow a Spider to anchor to a hull while working with tools.
*   **Side Effects:** Removal of the vestibular system (inner ear) to cure space sickness permanently.

### Class II: Tanks (Miners)
*   **Role:** Radiation zone harvesting, heavy lifting.
*   **Modification:** Subdermal lead/algae-resin composite injection (turns skin grey/metallic). Bone reinforcement with ceramic lacing.
*   **Benefit:** Can survive in hard radiation zones near Jupiter without shielding.
*   **Side Effects:** Reduced tactile sensation. Chronic joint pain from skeletal weight.

### Class III: Jacks (Pilots/Data)
*   **Role:** Ship navigation, market trading.
*   **Modification:** Spinal neural shunts. Atrophy of limb muscles ("Brains in Jars").
*   **Benefit:** Direct interface with ship sensors. Reaction times measured in milliseconds.
*   **Side Effects:** Dissociation from physical reality. High addiction rates to digital stimuli.

### Class IV: Stills (Metabolic Optimization)
*   **Role:** Long-haul survival, diplomacy, command.
*   **Modification:** Internal restructuring only. Digestive system replaced with a liquid-nutrient loop (no solid waste). Lungs replaced with high-efficiency oxygen scrubbers. Blood replaced with rad-resistant synthetic hemolymph.
*   **Visual:** Externally identical to a 'Standard' human, except for extreme pallor and the absence of a navel (replaced by a nutrient port).
*   **Benefit:** 50% less oxygen consumption. Can hibernate for weeks.

## Social Stigma
In the Belt, an unaugmented adult is viewed with suspicion. They are called **"Dead Weight"** or **"Tourists."** To refuse The Strip is to refuse to work, and in the [[the-bolas|Bolas]], if you don't work, you don't breathe.
