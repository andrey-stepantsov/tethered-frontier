# ARCHETYPE: THE BREAKER

**"If you can't open it, you don't own it. If you don't own it, it will kill you."**

### The Job
A **Breaker** is a specialized mechanic and hacker essential to every clan's survival. Their primary function is to bypass the Digital Rights Management (DRM) software embedded in corporate technology.

Earth corporations build life-support systems with "Planned Obsolescence"—air scrubbers designed to shut down after 5 years unless a license is renewed. Since Belters cannot afford to pay Earth for the right to breathe, Breakers hack the firmware.

### The Culture
Breakers view software locks as acts of aggression. "Right to Repair" is not a political stance; it is a religious tenant.
*   **Tools:** Custom firmware decks, soldering irons, and illegal decryption keys.
*   **Status:** Breakers are protected. You can kill a rival clan's Tank in a bar fight, but if you kill their Breaker, the entire station will turn on you. Nobody messes with the person who keeps the air pumps running.

### Famous Breakers
*   **Jax:** A legendary Breaker known for cracking the "Vanguard-7" water reclamation encryption, saving the Ceres slums during the Drought of '89.
