# The Breaker: Right to Repair

**"If you can't open it, you don't own it. And if you don't own it, it will kill you."**

The **Breaker** is a specialized hacker-mechanic essential to every Clan's survival. In the [[the-bolas|Bolas]], corporate machinery is designed with "Planned Obsolescence" and Digital Rights Management (DRM) that locks out users after the lease expires.

Since the corporations abandoned the Belt, these locks are now death sentences. The Breaker's job is to "jailbreak" life support systems, air scrubbers, and water recyclers.

## The Philosophy
For a Breaker, **Right to Repair** is not a political stance; it is a religion.
*   **Software Locks:** Viewed as active threats to life.
*   **Proprietary Tech:** Sinful.
*   **Open Source:** The only path to salvation.

## Tools of the Trade
*   **Bypass Chips:** Homemade circuit boards to override corporate auth.
*   **Legacy Code:** Knowledge of 100-year-old coding languages (C++, Rust, Assembly) found in the ancient ship cores.
*   **The Deck:** A wrist-mounted computer, often hardwired into the Breaker's nervous system (if they are a [[the-strip|Jack]]).

PROMPT: Surveillance footage, macro lens. A pair of grease-stained hands soldering a microchip onto a rusted circuit board. The board is glowing with bypass LEDs. In the background, a wall of monitors displays scrolling green code and "ACCESS GRANTED" warnings. The workspace is cluttered with wires, tools, and empty caffeine bulbs. High contrast, cyberpunk aesthetic, green and amber lighting.
