# Sarah Vance

> "Gravity is a luxury. Loyalty is a law."

**Role:** The Anchor / Captain
**Affiliation:** Vance Clan
**Status:** Unaugmented (Baseline Human)

## Profile
Sarah Vance is the gravitational center of her clan, both metaphorically and literally. As the Captain of the *Iron Lung*, she manages the delicate physics of the tether that binds their two habitat modules together. She is an **Anchor**—an elder who refuses "The Strip," maintaining a baseline human physiology to serve as the clan's biological control group and diplomat to Earth-aligned traders.

She looks twenty years older than her actual age. Without the radiation-hardened skin of a Tank or the neural shunts of a Jack, she is vulnerable. She wears a heavy, pressurized flight suit constantly, a visual reminder of her fragility in the void. Her authority comes not from physical strength, but from her ability to navigate the "Used Car Economy" and keep the air scrubbers running for one more cycle.

The image is grainy, washed in the amber monochrome of low-light security cameras. Sarah sits slumped in the command chair, rubbing her temples. The lighting is harsh, casting deep shadows that accentuate the bags under her eyes and the worry lines etched into her forehead. She is looking at a datapad, her face illuminated by its soft glow.
