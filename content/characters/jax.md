# Jax: The Four-Handed Mechanic

**" legs are just dead weight. You can't fix a thruster valve with your toes."**

Jax is a classic **Spider**, a Belter who underwent [[The Strip]] at age 18 to adapt to a life of Zero-G maintenance. He serves as the clan's primary [[The Breaker|Breaker]], keeping the life support systems running despite expired licenses and failing hardware.

## Physiology: The Spider
Jax is a testament to biological pragmatism.
*   **Lower Modification:** His legs were amputated at the knee. In their place, a second set of cybernetic forearms and hands were grafted. This allows him to anchor to hull struts while working with his "upper" hands.
*   **Vestibular System:** His inner ear has been surgically dampened to eliminate motion sickness, allowing him to orient in any direction without nausea.
*   **Atrophy:** Because he rarely enters the gravity wells of [[The Bolas]], his bone density is minimal. On Earth, he would collapse under his own weight. Here, he is an acrobat.

## The Tether Incident
During a routine inspection of the primary carbon cable, Jax noticed a "harmonic shimmer"—the cable was singing.

### The Fracture
He found a micro-fracture in the weave, likely caused by a micrometeoroid impact. In a rich system, they would replace the segment. In the **Used Car Economy**, they didn't have spare cable.

### The Poverty Fix
Jax had to improvise a structural splint before the stress of the spin caused a **Severance**.
1.  **The Material:** He cut a section of plating from a defunct waste-recycling drone.
2.  **The Bond:** Lacking industrial welding flux, he used a tube of "Structural Mastic" (space-grade superglue) that expired ten years ago.
3.  **The Hack:** To cure the mastic instantly, he hacked the safety limiters on his laser cutter, turning it into a high-intensity UV lamp.

He wrapped the fracture in the scrap metal, glued it shut, and baked it hard. It’s an ugly, lumpy scar on the sleek black cable, but it holds the ships together.

Generate a photorealistic First-Person POV shot from inside a dirty, scratched spacesuit helmet.

The Scene: We are looking at a mechanic ('Jax') standing in a dark, rusted corridor. He is gaunt, pale, wearing a greasy flight suit, and looks exhausted. He is glaring at the viewer.

The Augmented Reality Overlay:

Superimpose a glowing, low-fidelity Holographic UI over his face.



Style: Cyan/Green monochrome, wireframe aesthetics, retro-futuristic (think Alien motion tracker meets Terminator vision).

Glitch: The UI should be distorted—scanlines, dead pixels, and 'tracking error' artifacts to show the tech is cheap and broken.

Text Elements (Floating near his head):

CLASS: SPIDER

DEBT: CRITICAL

O2 RESERVES: 12%

Lighting: The only light comes from the glowing UI casting a faint green tint on Jax's face and the sparks from a wire he is holding.
