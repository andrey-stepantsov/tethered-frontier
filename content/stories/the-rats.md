# THE RATS: INCOMPLETE MANIFEST

**"Four limbs for the void. One brain for the ship. Two shields for the radiation. But no mouth for the deal."**

They call themselves **"The Rats"** because they grew up together in the same gravity well—a clutch of [[spin-rats|Spin-Rats]] who survived the "Airlock Filter" of adolescence. Now, they are adults, and they have undergone [[the-strip|The Strip]]. They are specialized tools in a broken toolbox.

But the toolbox is missing a wrench.

## The Crew Manifest

### 1. Kael (Class: [[tanks|Tank]])
*   **Role:** The Shield / Heavy Labor.
*   **Physiology:** 2.2 meters tall. Skin is a dull, slate-grey from the lead-algae dermal plating.
*   **The Vibe:** He moves slowly in the ship's 0.3G spin, his basalt-ceramic bones too heavy for grace. He smells like ozone and hot metal. He is the one who goes outside when the solar flares hit.

### 2. Ria (Class: [[tanks|Tank]])
*   **Role:** Demolitions / Mining.
*   **Physiology:** Compact, dense, and metallic. Her face is a mask of scars and grey plating.
*   **The Vibe:** Volatile. She uses a modified industrial riveter as a sidearm. She hates "Inners" (Earthers) with a religious fervor, mostly because her vocal cords were damaged by rock dust, making her sound like grinding gears.

### 3. Vex (Class: [[spiders|Spider]])
*   **Role:** The Mechanic / Fixer.
*   **Physiology:** Legs amputated at the hip. A second pair of fine-motor manipulators (hands) are grafted to his torso.
*   **The Vibe:** He never touches the floor. He swings from the overhead pipes in the Zero-G hub, fixing the scrubbers that Kael breaks. He is the only one who can navigate the ship's "Web" without vomiting, thanks to his removed inner ears.

### 4. Io (Class: [[jacks|Jack]])
*   **Role:** The Pilot / Navigator.
*   **Physiology:** Emaciated. Atrophied muscles. A bundle of fiber-optic cables trails from the base of their skull into the ship's console.
*   **The Vibe:** Io rarely speaks verbally. They text the crew via HUD overlays. They view reality through the ship's sensors, seeing the universe in vector graphics and thermal gradients.

## The Problem: The Missing Still

The Rats have just pulled off the salvage of a lifetime: a pristine crate of pre-collapse Intel microchips found in a drifting wreck near the Jupiter perimeter. It's worth enough water to keep them alive for a decade.

**But they can't sell it.**

To sell high-value contraband to the Corporate stations, you need a **Face**. You need a [[the-strip|Still]].
*   **Stills** look human (mostly).
*   **Stills** can talk without a vox-coder.
*   **Stills** understand the subtle lies of diplomacy.

The Rats are monsters.
*   If Kael or Ria walk into a corporate office, security shoots on sight (Radiation hazard).
*   Vex freaks people out (Too many hands).
*   Io is catatonic when unplugged.

They are a body without a voice. They are sitting on a fortune, drifting in the dark, arguing over who has to go knock on the airlock door.

> **Vex:** "I could wear pants. Fake legs."
> **Ria:** "You have four hands, idiot. You'd look like a dog in a suit."
> **Io (Text Overlay):** *PROBABILITY OF NEGOTIATION SUCCESS: 0.04%. WE NEED A MOUTH.*
