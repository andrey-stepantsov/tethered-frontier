# SYSTEM ALERT: LEASE EXPIRED

**Welcome to the Rust Belt. Leave your romanticism at the airlock.**

If you are reading this, you have drifted past the Mars perimeter. You are now in the domain of **Poverty Physics**. Forget the shiny chrome of Earth's propaganda. Out here, we don't have artificial gravity or infinite energy. We have what we could salvage, what we could steal, and what we could hack.

### 1. The Geography of Isolation
Space is not measured in distance; it is measured in **Lag**.
*   **The Inner Ring (<10m Lag):** Corporate patrolled. If you scream, they might hear you.
*   **The Fringe (>20m Lag):** The "Wild West." By the time your distress signal reaches Earth, you've been dead for an hour. This is where we live.
*   **The Dark:** Beyond the belt. No signal. No survival.

### 2. The Used Car Economy
We live in the wreckage of the "Rust Recession." Every ship in this sector is a fifty-year-old corporate castoff. We keep the air scrubbers running with bypassed DRM and duct tape.

**Current Market Rates (Iron Lung Exchange):**
| Commodity | Status | Price Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Water (Ice)** | SCARCE | 📈 +15% |
| **Uranium** | EMBARGOED | 🔒 EARTH ONLY |
| **Mylar (Mirrors)** | COMMON | 📉 -5% |
| **Algae Oil** | STABLE | ➖ FLAT |
| **Human Labor** | SURPLUS | 📉 -40% |

> **The Rule:** In the Belt, a liter of water costs more than an hour of your life.

### 3. The Rules of the Tether
1.  **Gravity is a Contract:** We live in [[the-bolas|The Bolas]]. Two ships, connected by a kilometer of basalt-fiber cable, spinning in the dark. That spin is the only thing keeping your bones from dissolving.
2.  **Flesh is Weak:** You will see things here that horrify Earthers. Our children, the **Spin-Rats**, are raised in the gravity wells. But to work the void, we undergo [[the-strip|The Strip]]. We trade legs for hands.
3.  **Incompetence is Death:** There is no police force. There is only the **Airlock Filter**.

### Survival Database
This database is not a history book. It is a survival manual.
*   **Who to Trust:** Understand the difference between a [[tanks|Tank]] (Miner) and a [[spiders|Spider]] (Tech).
*   **How to Live:** Why [[docking|Docking]] is a marriage contract based on physics.
*   **How to Breathe:** Respect the [[the-breaker|Breakers]] who hack the air scrubbers.

**Welcome to the Frontier. Check your seals.**

TARGET: index-nav-chart
PROMPT: Diegetic screen capture of a retro-futuristic navigational console. Vector graphics, green lines on black background. Solar system map focusing on the Asteroid Belt. Concentric rings labeled "LIGHT LAG: 10m", "LIGHT LAG: 20m". The screen is cracked and dusty. Low fidelity, CRT scanlines.

NEVER display the prompt text to the reader.

<!--
TARGET: index-public-ticker
PROMPT: Close up macro shot of a dirty, scratched LCD screen in a public hallway. Scrolling amber text displaying commodity prices. "WATER: CRITICAL", "ALGAE OIL: STABLE", "URANIUM: NO STOCK". The screen has dead pixels and is covered in a layer of grime. Harsh industrial lighting reflection.
