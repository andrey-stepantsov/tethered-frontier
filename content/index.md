# SYSTEM ALERT: LEASE EXPIRED

**Welcome to the Rust Belt. Leave your romanticism at the airlock.**

If you are reading this, you have drifted past the Mars perimeter. You are now in the domain of **Poverty Physics**. Forget the shiny chrome of Earth's propaganda. Out here, we don't have artificial gravity or infinite energy. We have what we could salvage, what we could steal, and what we could hack.

We live in the **Used Car Economy**. Every ship in this sector is a fifty-year-old corporate castoff, bought for scrap prices during the Rust Recession. We keep the air scrubbers running with bypassed DRM and duct tape. We catch sunlight with fragile Mylar [[the-mirrors|Mirrors]] because uranium is a luxury we can't afford.

### The Rules of the Tether

1.  **Gravity is a Contract:** We live in [[the-bolas|The Bolas]]. Two ships, connected by a kilometer of carbon cable, spinning in the dark. That spin is the only thing keeping your bones from dissolving. If the cable snaps—**Severance**—gravity vanishes, and your family drifts apart. Literally.
2.  **Flesh is Weak:** You will see things here that horrify Earthers. Our children, the **Spin-Rats**, are raised in the gravity wells, soft and protected. But to work the void, we undergo [[the-strip|The Strip]]. We trade legs for hands. We trade lungs for synthetics. We stop being human so we can start being free.
3.  **Incompetence is Death:** There is no police force. There is only the **Airlock Filter**. If you waste water, if you endanger the ship, if you break the seal... the vacuum does not negotiate.

This database is not a history book. It is a survival manual. Learn the difference between a [[tanks|Tank]] and a [[spiders|Spider]]. Understand why [[docking|Docking]] is a marriage contract. Respect the [[the-breaker|Breakers]] who keep the oxygen flowing.

### The Geography of Scarcity

The solar system is defined by who holds the keys to survival. We call this dynamic **The Leash**.

*   **Earth Holds:** Uranium (Energy), Microchips (Compute), and Biologics (Soil/Seeds). They starve us to keep us obedient.
*   **The Belt Holds:** Metals, Ice, and **The High Ground**. We sit at the top of the gravity well. If they cut the food shipments, we drop rocks. It is a cold war of physics.
*   **The Goal:** Autarky. We are fighting to manufacture our own chips and medicine to break The Leash.

### Anatomy of the Rust Belt

*   **The Fleet:** There are no new ships. We fly the "Rust Recession" fleet—depreciated haulers sold to us by Earth corporations 50 years ago. They are held together by patches and prayer.
*   **The Rocks:** Those who can't afford ships live in hollowed-out asteroids. These are spun up for gravity, but the rock is often unstable. A "Dust-Out" occurs when the centrifugal force tears the asteroid apart from the inside.
*   **The Tech:** We rely on **Poverty Physics**. High-tech solutions break. We use mechanical levers, analog backups, and massive, fragile Mylar mirrors to concentrate weak sunlight for heating ice.

**Welcome to the Frontier. Check your seals.**
